//Like while loops, do loops let you repeat a section of code based on an expression.
//The difference is that a do loop tests its expression after each loop iteration. 
// This means that the loop body is always executed at least once. 

// Hereâ€™s a generic form of a do loop:
//  do
//      statement;
//  while(expression);

// The program executes the statment and as long as the expression is true it keeps running.
// Once it is false, it stops.
